Males are four times more likely to have autism than females. Some children with autism appear normal before age 1 or 2 and then suddenly &ldquo;regress&rdquo; and lose language or social skills they had previously gained. This is called the regressive type of autism.</p> <h3>Early Signs</h3> <p>A person with ASD might:</p> <ul> <li>Not respond to their name (the child may appear deaf)</li> <li>Not point at objects or things of interest, or demonstrate interest</li> <li>Not play &ldquo;pretend&rdquo; games</li> <li>Avoid eye contact</li> <li>Want to be alone</li> <li>Have difficulty understanding, or showing understanding, or other people&rsquo;s feelings or their own</li> <li>Have no speech or delayed speech</li> <li>Repeat words or phrases over and over (echolalia)</li> <li>Give unrelated answers to questions</li> <li>Get upset by minor changes</li> <li>Have obsessive interests</li> <li>Flap their hands, rock their body, or spin in circles</li> <li>Have unusual reactions (over or under-sensitivity) to the way things sound, smell, taste, look, or feel</li> <li>Have low to no social skills</li> <li>Avoid or resist physical contact</li> <li>Demonstrate little safety or danger awareness</li> <li>Reverse pronouns (e.g., says &ldquo;you&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;I&rdquo;)</li> </ul> <h3>People with autism may also</h3> <ul> <li>Have unusual interests and behaviors</li> <li>Have extreme anxiety and phobias, as well as unusual phobias</li> <li>Line up toys or other objects</li> <li>Play with toys the same way every time</li> <li>Like parts of objects (e.g., wheels)</li> <li>Become upset by minor changes</li> <li>Have obsessive interests</li> </ul> <h3>Other Symptoms</h3> <ul> <li>Hyperactivity (very active)</li> <li>Impulsivity (acting without thinking)</li> <li>Short attention span</li> <li>Aggression</li> <li>Causing self injury</li> <li>Meltdowns</li> <li>Unusual eating and sleeping habits</li> <li>Unusual mood or emotional reactions</li> <li>Lack of fear or more fear than expected</li> <li>Have unusual sleeping habits</li> </ul>"

  	  body: "<h3>Autism Therapy with MITA</h3> <p> <b>Description: </b> This pediatrician recommended app includes bright, interactive puzzles designed to help children learn how to mentally integrate multiple features of an object, an ability proven to lead to vast improvements in general learning. MITA is based on Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT), one of the best-supported therapies for children diagnosed with ASD. The puzzles target three of four critical areas of development supported by PRT: response to multiple cues, motivation, and self-management. A child’s ability to notice and to respond to multiple visual cues presented simultaneously is the most critical. This ability is typically impaired in individuals with autism, leading to what is commonly described as “stimulus overselectivity”, or “tunnel vision.” Improving the capacity to respond to multiple cues has been shown to reduce stimulus overselectivity, which in turn leads to vast improvements in general learning. <br> <b>Categories: </b> Games, Educational, Speech, Entertainment <br> <b>iOS rating: </b> 5 <br> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/autism-therapy-with-mita/id1020290425\">iOS link</a> </p> <hr>   <h3>Upper Case – Autism Series</h3> <p> <b>Description: </b> Upper Case introduces children to the alphabet via engaging coloring pages that capture their attention.
